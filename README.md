Introduction to React.js

This repository includes a smal project which demonstrates the basics of react components. 

A react app is set of reusable components which are just like functions, they take input and produce a user interface in the form of react element.
The React DOM library enabled us to render those react elements in the browser efficiently. The input for the component is a set of properties 
you can access inside the component with the props object,and also a set of state elements that can be accesed with the state object.

React has two types of components 
1. Function Components
2. Class components

1. Function components can be defined with simple functions that recieves a props object and return a React element. Class component can be defined by
   extending the React.component class and defining a render function returns a React element
